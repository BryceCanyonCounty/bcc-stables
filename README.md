## Horse Taming
- Tame wild horses and return to a trainer area to sell or register your tamed horse.
  - If you want to keep the tame and have room in your stable, pay a registration fee, and it will be added to your stable.
- Job check if Trainer job is required.
- If the player does not have the Trainer job, the tamed horse can be given to a trainer to sell or register.

## Horse Trading
- While leading your horse, approach another player, and a trade prompt will appear.

## Tips
- **Whistling**: A short whistle will call your horse. A long one will set your horse to follow you. A second whistle or mounting your horse will cancel following.
- **Horse Info**: Press `Q` in the horse prompts to view standard horse info.

## Commands
