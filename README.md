# bcc-stables

#### Features

- Cash and/or gold may be used for payments in the menu
- Max player horses is set in the config (default: 5)
- Individual inventory for each horse
- Choose horse gender at purchase
- Use oil lantern from inventory to equip a lantern to your horse
- Shop hours may be set individually for each stable or disabled to allow the stable to remain open
- Stable blips are colored and changeable per stable location
- Blips can change color reflecting if stable is open, closed or job locked
- Stable access can be limited by job and jobgrade
